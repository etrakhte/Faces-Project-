# Faces-Project-
My iteration of the Faces prompt for Creative Programming II derives inspirations from Andy Warhol's pop-art portraits of Marilyn Monroe. This code uses the openCV library to identify line patterns in face images and then erodes and dilates them.
Each iteration which becomes a little more imperfect is to simulate the inconsistencies within prints along the same color and style as Andy Warhol.
